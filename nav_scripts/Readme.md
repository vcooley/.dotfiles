## Navigation Scripts
These scripts are intended to be bound to specific hotkeys in order to launch specific windows of applications that I use in my workflow. They are written to be compatible with Raycast (hence the special headers) but should work with any application that supports hotkey launching.

### Requirements
- `yabai` for window management and querying
- `jq` for JSON parsing

### Display Setup
These scripts are written assuming the following applications are arranged across two displays.
#### Display 1 (Macbook Pro internal display)
- Debugging Chrome instance with "Tesorio" in the window title

#### Display 2 (External display)
- General purpose Google Chrome
  - Google Meet or other meeting app on tab 3
- VS Code
